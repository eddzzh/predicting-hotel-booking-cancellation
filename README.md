# How Can Hotel Manager Develop Prescient Knowledge of Room Cancellation?

## Quick Overview
Traditionally, occupancy rate is considered to be one of the top three most useful KPI's the efficiency of hotel's revenue management strategy. One of the culprit of hotel revenue loss is cancellation on short notice. The objective of this project is to build a binary classifier to forecast whether a hotel booking will be cancelled or completed based on range of booking features. The analysis could help hotel management to develop prescient knowledge of early indicators for cancellation. The prediction results can be used to devise overbooking strategies to recuperate revenue losses from bookings with high chance of cancellation.

- Optimized Logistic, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, and Random Forest Regressors using Step-wise AIC, GridsearchCV, 10-Fold CV.
- Random forest model performed the best in predicting cancellation using unseen data, achieving an AUROC of 0.9225 and an accuracy of 0.9225.
